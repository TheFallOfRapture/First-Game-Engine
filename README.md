# First Game Engine (alternatively, No Good Naming Ideas Yet)

One day in Summer 2016, I had the idea of taking my old AP Computer Science final project and making a game engine out of it. A number of weeks later, on August 26, 2016, I pushed the new game engine I had to this repository.

## Hierarchy
### src
Source code. Obviously.
#### com/fate
##### engine
Code common to all games created using this library. Could be thought of as the actual "engine" part of this repository.
##### game
Games created with this game engine. Can be thought of as "demos".

**All content beyond here is subject to change.**

###### flappybird
The project that started it all. The code has been modified since its days as a school project. FlappyBirdLauncher is the main class, if you really want to run my crappy Flappy Bird clone. Please don't. It's probably broken.
###### platformer
??? (Mostly just abandoned code. Probably going to end up deleted some time in the near future.)
###### shooting
Testing grounds for a game idea I had where you have a player that has a pre-determined movement pattern and to win the level, you must manipulate blocks in the environment to get the player to an exit.
###### testing
Not really used for testing. Mostly just abandoned code. Probably will end up deleting the folder entirely.
