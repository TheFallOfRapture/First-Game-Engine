# First Game Engine

One day in Summer 2016, I had the idea of taking my old AP Computer Science final project and making a game engine out of it. A number of weeks later, on August 26, 2016, I pushed the new game engine I had to this repository.

This repository is mainly for storage and version control purposes. No contributions are necessary.

As this engine is very young, the code is currently very unstable and may change at any time.

com/fate/engine contains the game engine files.

com/fate/game contains game projects (demos).

res contains game resources.
